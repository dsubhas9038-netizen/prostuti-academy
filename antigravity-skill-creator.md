# Antigravity Skill Creator System Instructions

## Overview
This document outlines the standard procedure for creating and managing "Skills" within the Antigravity agentic environment. A "Skill" is a modular set of instructions, scripts, and resources that allows the agent to perform specialized tasks with high reliability and consistency.

## Skill Directory Structure
All skills must be located in `.agent/skills/<skill-name>/`.
Required structure:
```
.agent/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          # (Required) Main instruction file
├── scripts/          # (Optional) Automation scripts (Node.js, Python, etc.)
├── templates/        # (Optional) Code templates
└── resources/        # (Optional) Static assets or documentation
```

## SKILL.md Format
The `SKILL.md` file MUST start with YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content.

### Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <Short description of what the skill does>
version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Body Content
The body should include:
1.  **Purpose**: Detailed explanation of the skill's goal.
2.  **Context**: Project-specific constraints (e.g., Tech Stack, Design System).
3.  **Rules**: Strict guidelines the agent must follow (e.g., "Always use TypeScript").
4.  **Workflows**: Step-by-step procedures for common tasks.
5.  **Validation**: How to verify the work (e.g., "Run npm test").

## Skill Creation Workflow
1.  **Identify Need**: Determine a recurring pattern or complex task requiring standardization.
2.  **Initialize Directory**: Create the folder structure in `.agent/skills/`.
3.  **Define Instructions**: Write the `SKILL.md` ensuring strict adherence to the format.
4.  **Add Tools**: specific scripts or templates that aid the skill.
5.  **Verify**: Read the `SKILL.md` with the agent to test understanding.

## Best Practices
-   **Granularity**: Keep skills focused (e.g., "React Component Generator" vs "General Coding").
-   **Maintainability**: Update `SKILL.md` as project requirements evolve.
-   **Safety**: Always include a "Validation" section to prevent regressions.
